# FaceGroup App

The idea is to read facebook groups feed, without using the facebook.com website. Developers and group administrators will love it. No distractions.

# Features
* Read your facebook Groups outside of the facebook website
* Create "tagged" feeds. Combine two or more groups into one single timeline. (Ex: javascript groups)
* Post/Edit/Comment posts
* Favorite posts and list later
* Post in multiple groups (Maybe, this is dangerous)

# Roadmap
* Built the front-end based on the existing layout 
* Add cache to requests
* Setup the domain to gh-pages
* Add embed.ly or noembed to make the timeline pretty
* Create "grouped" or "tagged" timelines (Select multiple groups and read the feed in only one timeline)
* Add feature to LIKE the post
* Add feature to POST in groups
* Add feature to favorite posts
* Add feature to comment in posts
* Add feature to delete posts
